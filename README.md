# Translation_hackathon

There are two different notebooks:
1- Landmark classification and detection model
2- Object detection model 



## 1- Landmark classification and detection model
This notebook is an example of our idea (part of it not all) where it will classifiy images, due to lack of images we used landmark images from all around the world, part of our requirements is to get more data using our application with the help of annotators we can make the model specified to our culture

requirements for this notebook:
- PyTorch framework
- anaconda
- python
- GPU and workstation

if you faced any errors kindly look it up online


## 2- Object detection model
this notebook is using deep learning method, to detect objects and here we are using dates datasets to classifiy and detect kind of date

requirements for this notebook:
- tensorflow
- anaconda
- python
- GPU and workstation



if you faced any errors kindly look it up online, and it's due to your device configuration
